/* The STATION table is described as follows:


+-------------+------------+
| Field       |   Type     |
+-------------+------------+
| ID          | INTEGER    |
| CITY        | VARCHAR(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMERIC    |
| LONG_W      | NUMERIC    |
+-------------+------------+

Let N be the number of CITY entries in STATION, and let N’ be the number of distinct CITY names in STATION; 
query the value of N - N’ from STATION. In other words, 

find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table. */

SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(DISTINCT CITY) FROM STATION ;
